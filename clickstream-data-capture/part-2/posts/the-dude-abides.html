	<h1>The Dude Abides</h1>
	<br/>
	<p>The Dude abides. And so, Theodore Donald Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well. Yeah man. Call the medics, Dude. HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY! No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary.</p>
	
	<p>LOGJAMMIN'. You're going to enter a world of pain, son. We know that this is your homework. We know you stole a car. How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter? Thankie… Just one thing, Dude. D'ya have to use s'many cuss words? This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is—are you ready for this? —Arthur Digby Sellers. </p>
	
	<p>Since you have failed to achieve, even in the modest task that was your charge, since you have stolen my money, and since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust. Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski. Your "revolution" is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost! I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter. Uh, yeah. Probably a vagrant, slept in the car. </p>
	
	<p>No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the impression that we're police exactly. We're hoping that it will not be necessary to call the police. D'ya have a good sarsaparilla? Walter, this isn't a First Amendment thing. I like your style, Dude. Dieter doesn't care about anything. He's a nihilist. Hey! This is a private residence, man!</p>
	
	<p>Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski! That is our most modestly priced receptacle. Hardly Dude, a new 'vette? The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options. I'm unemployed. He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe.</p>
	
	<p>These men are nihilists, Donny, nothing to be afraid of. Near the In-and-Out Burger. WE HAVE BUNNY. GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON-CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES. AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS. NO FUNNY STUFF. I, uh… money, yeah, I gotta respectfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all. They're nihilists. Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.</p>
	
	<p>Our basic freedoms. Ja, it seems you forgot our little deal, Lebowski. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong. If there's one thing I learned in Nam—. Over the line! And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other —in bed with everybody— fabulous stuff, man. You know, little of this, little of that.</p>
	
	<p>Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle. Would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course. Is this your homework, Larry? I'll get you a toe by this afternoon —with nail polish. Another Caucasian, Gary. Ever hear of the Seattle Seven? Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.</p>
